# Perceptron

Simple trainable neuron (console app).

This Perceptron implementation can be trained to determine whether given point (x, y) is located above or below graph of f(x) = ax + b function. Perceptron accuracy depends on number of learning iterations.

User can input the number of learning iterations to see how it performs depending on the training.
